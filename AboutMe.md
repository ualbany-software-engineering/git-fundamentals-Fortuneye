I'm Izabella Palange! Currently a senior here.
I currently know C(/some C++ too), Java, SQL, and some minimal Python.

In terms of CS, one side of things I have some interest in is computer security! I've always been very good at fixing software/OS problems for both myself and friends/family too, so the more customer service-y IT related jobs have interested me as well.
Over the past couple of summers I've been learning a very simple Visual Novel video game engine called Ren'Py and making my own game using it which I've been updating via Itch.io!

I've never made any kind of software before so I'm excited to finally see how that process works for myself!
